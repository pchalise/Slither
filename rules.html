<p>
The rules of <it>Slither</it> are very simple.
</p>

<p>
Each player chooses an edge alternately to make a path. A player is allowed to lengthen the 
path on the either side but should lengthen the same path. The one who cannot make the path any longer loses.
This means, in a game of 3 players, there are 2 winners.
</p>

<p>
For the simulations, the computer plays against itself. You may choose how many simulations to run and sit back and watch.
